# Flutter Project Structure

## Flutter Project Directory Structure

Let's create a first Flutter app. 

I've run the command: `flutter create namer_app`

Here is the directory structure, please explain the purpose of each file/folder:

```zsh
(base) ➜  namer_app tree -L 1
.
├── README.md
├── analysis_options.yaml
├── android
├── ios
├── lib
├── linux
├── macos
├── namer_app.iml
├── pubspec.lock
├── pubspec.yaml
├── test
├── web
└── windows
```

- **`README.md`**: Documentation file for your project.

- **`analysis_options.yaml`**: Configures Dart analyzer for code quality.

- **Platform-specific folders**:
  - `android/`, `ios/`: Mobile platform configurations
  - `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`: Desktop platform configurations
  - `web/`: Web platform configuration

- **Core project files**:
  - `lib/`: Contains your Dart code - this is where you'll spend most time
  - `pubspec.yaml`: Defines project metadata and dependencies
  - `pubspec.lock`: Auto-generated file that locks dependency versions

- **`test/`**: Contains automated tests for your application

For a beginner, focus on exploring the `lib/main.dart` file (your app's entry point) and understanding the `pubspec.yaml` file for dependency management before building simple widgets in the `lib` directory.

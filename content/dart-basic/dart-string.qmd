## String Interpolation

### Multi-line String Literals

**Triple quotes (most similar to Python):**
```dart
String multiLine = '''
This is a multi-line string
just like Python's triple quotes.
You can include line breaks naturally.
''';

// Or with double quotes
String anotherMultiLine = """
This also works with double quotes.
Line breaks are preserved.
""";
```

**Adjacent string concatenation:**
```dart
String concatenated = 'This is line one '
    'and this continues on the same logical line '
    'but split across multiple physical lines.';
```

### String Interpolation in Multi-line Strings

Dart's string interpolation works great with multi-line strings:

```dart
String name = 'Dr. Smith';
int age = 35;

String profile = '''
Doctor Profile:
Name: $name
Age: $age
Specialty: ${name.contains('Dr') ? 'Medical' : 'Unknown'}
''';
```

### Raw Multi-line Strings

Use `r` prefix to create raw strings (no escape sequences processed):

```dart
String rawMultiLine = r'''
This is a raw multi-line string.
\n won't create a new line
${name} won't interpolate
''';
```

The triple quote syntax (`'''` or `"""`) is the most direct equivalent to Python's approach and is commonly used in Flutter for things like:

- Multi-line text widgets
- SQL queries
- JSON templates
- Documentation strings

This should feel quite familiar coming from your Python background!

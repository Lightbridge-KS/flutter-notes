# Deploy Localhost

::: {.callout-note appearance="default" collapse="false"}
**Q:** Let's say I have build a simple Flutter app to "web" target with:

```zsh
flutter build web --no-web-resources-cdn --release
```

I want to serve this app to a localhost with certain port in my MacBook Pro. This app can work with client-side logic only (no API call, no database connection, no routing).

Here are the main approaches to serve your Flutter web app locally:

## **Approaches & Options**

### **1. Python HTTP Server** ⭐ (Recommended for you)
Since you prefer Python, this is the simplest approach:
- Uses Python's built-in `http.server` module
- No additional installations needed
- Can specify custom port easily

### **2. Flutter Development Server**
- Use Flutter's built-in web server
- Good for development/testing
- Automatic reload capabilities

### **3. Node.js `serve` Package**
- If you have Node.js installed
- Very lightweight and fast
- Good port management

### **4. VS Code Live Server**
- Since you use VS Code
- GUI-based approach
- Browser auto-refresh

## **Specific Commands**

### **Option 1: Python HTTP Server** (Simplest)
```zsh
# Navigate to your Flutter web build directory
cd your_flutter_project/build/web

# Serve on default port 8000
python3 -m http.server

# Serve on custom port (e.g., 3000)
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

### **Option 2: Flutter Web Server**
```zsh
# In your Flutter project root
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3000 --web-hostname=localhost

# Or for release mode
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3000 --release
```

### **Option 3: Node.js serve** (if Node.js installed)
```zsh
# Install globally (one-time)
npm install -g serve

# Serve the build directory
cd your_flutter_project/build/web
serve -s . -l 3000
```

### **Simple ASCII Diagram:**

```
Flutter Project Structure:
├── lib/
├── web/
├── build/
│   └── web/          ← Serve this directory
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── main.dart.js
│       └── assets/
└── pubspec.yaml

Flow:
[Flutter Build] → [build/web/] → [HTTP Server] → [localhost:port]
```

**Recommendation:** Start with **Option 1 (Python)** since it's built into macOS, requires no setup, and aligns with your Python preference. Just `cd` into `build/web` and run `python3 -m http.server 3000` to serve on port 3000.
